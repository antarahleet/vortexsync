Tucked into a quiet neighborhood, this home is truly a """"hidden gem"""". Escape your busy life, and just relax outside on the back patio with wooded views, or sit up high on your deck and watch the ever-changing marsh with its wildlife. The flexible floor plan with two kitchens and finished walkout lower level is great for entertaining or multi-generational living. Updates include newly re-finished hardwood floors, Fujitsu Mini Splits, Rinnai tankless boiler, and 3 bed septic system. Oversized shed with electricity is an opportunity for an art studio or getaway space. The fenced in back yard has a patio, firepit, and outdoor shower/bathroom, while the side yard offers an additional fire pit and sitting area amongst the flowers and shrubs. Close to shopping and restaurants. This unique property offers vacation rental/ADU possibilities as well!
* agent remarks: Both sets of washers/dryers are to convey with the home. The septic is for 3 bedrooms with a 1500 gallon tank, but house lives like a 4-5 bedroom home. Radiant heat in lower level. Great rental history with VRBO. Town maintains Lookout Point Rd. Path to beach is across the street and easily marked. Propane is for fireplace, stoves and Rinnai boiler. ADU possibility with walkout lower level.

* remarks: Nestled in the sought-after Parkwood Beach Association, just two blocks from the beach, this long-time family home offers captivating river views.This 2-bedroom bungalow holds immense potential. Having started renovations, this home presents a blank canvas with NO existing bedrooms or working facilities due to the removal of all interior walls. Home is on Town Sewer. The electrical panel has been upgraded, though power is not currently connected. Improvements include new windows, a new back slider, and a new front door. A new heat pump awaits connection. Previous plans (not currently available) envisioned adding a second floor! Please note that there are open permits, which will be the responsibility of the Buyer, and financing is NOT an option. An exciting opportunity to make this property something really special.
* agent remarks: Heirs request 72 hrs to review all offers. Property has outstanding permits that will be Buyer responsibility. Extensive exterior and interior work needed.

* remarks: This cherished home has been in this family for over 60 years.  With a heavy heart they must sell their beloved  waterfront cottage.  Enjoy all that lighthouse Road has to offer.  Highly coveted and convenient location close to Scituate Harbor with all that it has to offer, dining, boating and shopping.  Imagine having the ability to live directly on the water in the Cedar point area.  Walk out  your door and hop into the water for boating or swimming!!  There is not much on the market that gives you the ability to build the home of your dreams on such an amazing location.
* agent remarks: Do not walk the property without listing agent the home is occupied.  The value of this home is in the property itself. The cottage can only be shown after the first showing and if there is true interest the cottage will be shown.  Sold as is, Betterment has been paid
